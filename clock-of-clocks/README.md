# Clock of Clocks

Years ago I came across the <a href='https://clockclock.com/' target="_blank">ClockClock</a> by <a href='https://www.humanssince1982.com/' target="_blank">Humans since 1982</a>.
ClockClock's mesmerizing patterns and smooth transitions are captivating and demand the <a href="https://clockclock.com/collections/clockclock-24/products/clockclock-24-white" target="_blank">hefty price tag</a>.
Here, I coded a "Clock of Clocks" with <a href='https://p5js.org/' target="_blank">p5.js</a> that contains 160 "analog" clocks that display the time when the minute changes.
Otherwise it will randomly rotate the clock hands until the next minute (more patterns to come).
